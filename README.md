Idea
==================

Parents need to know that Ellen's Know or Go is an often silly, and other times educational, trivia game. Based on a game that Ellen DeGeneres plays on her daytime TV talk show, the app is peppered with Ellen's own voice-over comments. There are three levels of question difficulty, but the questions must be read by the player, so good readings skills are a must. Players create their own contestant using a pre-made character or by inserting a photo of themselves onto a funny avatar body and then choosing their own wardrobe selections. If your child is a teen with a Facebook account, this game can be linked up to their account, and there's also optional Game Center integration for multiplayer games and leaderboard scores.
